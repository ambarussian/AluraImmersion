# Event by Alura: Dev Immersion with Google Gemini
A hands-on website development project, supported by Google Gemini to assist in resolving technical queries, featuring five online video classes hosted by Alura, a brazilian tech education platform. The project utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as the core languages.

## Features
- Search for artists and songs;
- Promote musicians' work;
- Simple interface, with a prototype of what would be the user profile.

## Languages
- `HTML5`: Site structure;
- `CSS`: Styling and design;
- `JavaScript`: Application logic for searching musicians, navigating between login, sign-up, and index pages.

## Project Structure
- `login.html`: Initial login page;
- `signup.html`: Initial sign-up page;
- `index.html`: Main page with the search bar, as well as musicians and song descriptions;
- `style.css`: File containing the design and styling for all pages;
- `data.js`: Contains the database with musicians and their details;
- `app.js`: Search function that displays results according to the user's query.

### Additional Details:
<small>As my first code using the previously mentioned languages, I know there is a lot of room to explore and expand, such as redirecting the user to the artist's page they searched for, displaying song lyrics, allowing the user to favorite songs, and enabling them to access their profile. It is also interesting to explore the use of images, which faced some challenges throughout the project.
